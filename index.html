    <h1>Aryan Kumar Barnwal</h1>
    <h2>College Student</h2>
    <p>I am an undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram taking Computer Science as my major. 
        I developed an interest in coding when I was introduced to my very first programming language in my school. 
        Since then I have been exploring various programming languages and later took up Computer science for my further studies. 
        I strive to achieve a career as a Software Engineer.</p>
