<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram taking Computer Science as my major.
   I developed an interest in coding when I was introduced to my very first programming language in my school. 
   Since then I have been exploring various programming languages and later took up Computer science for my further studies. 
   I strive to achieve a career as a Software Engineer.</p>
